Vision Transformer (ViT) Image Classification Task

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The notebook includes the complete pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.


📌 Project Overview

Vision Transformers (ViT) are a novel deep learning architecture for vision tasks that treat images as sequences of patches and apply transformer models (commonly used in NLP). This project showcases:

Loading and preprocessing image data

Building a ViT-based image classification model

Training and validating the model

Evaluating performance with accuracy and confusion matrix

🚀 Features

✅ Implementation using tensorflow.keras.applications.ViT

✅ Training on a custom dataset (loaded using ImageDataGenerator)

✅ Real-time data augmentation

✅ Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

✅ Easy to understand and modify notebook
